# Hanging

This is a simple Hanging Man game I'm developing for study purposes. The first version was really sloppy, so I refactored the code and this is what you get here.

This game is being developed on an ongoing process. It's not finished yet, there are a couple of things I want to implement, just to practice some design choices. Probably will never be finished.
